#Plugin for CO2 tracker 

This plugin is for adding CO2 tracking feature on climactivity website.

Another pluing buddypress-user-profile-tabs-creator-pro is for creating a new tab on user profile 

Combination of this two plugin will make this work easy

One new Table name as "tracking" must be included in DB

Getting exact user_id and solving the database issue is the remaining task.
